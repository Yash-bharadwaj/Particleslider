Particle Image Project

This repository contains a particle-based project that utilizes an image as the source for creating dynamic particle effects. The project aims to showcase the creative potential of particles and provide an interactive visual experience.

Features:
- Particle-based animation: The project leverages particles to create captivating animations that bring the image to life.
- Customizable settings: Users can adjust various parameters, such as particle size, density, speed, and color, to customize the visual effects.
- Image integration: The project utilizes an input image as the foundation for generating particles, allowing users to experiment with different images and see how particles interact with them.
- Interactive controls: The project provides an intuitive interface with interactive controls that enable users to manipulate the particle effects in real time.
- Responsive design: The project is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across different devices and screen sizes.

Technologies used:
- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript: The project is built using these web technologies to create the particle animations and user interface.
- Particle.js library: The particle effects are implemented using the Particle.js library, which simplifies the creation and management of particles.
- [Other libraries or frameworks used, if applicable]

To run the project locally, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser. Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different images and particle settings to create unique visual effects.
